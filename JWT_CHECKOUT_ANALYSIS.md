# JWT Checkout Flow Analysis

## 🔍 Investigation: Why No CheckoutService Logs?

**Question:** Why don't we see JWT logs from CheckoutService during the test?

**Answer:** The checkout request is **rejected by Frontend validation** before it reaches CheckoutService!

---

## 📋 What Actually Happens

### Checkout Flow (Attempted)

```
1. Browser sends POST /cart/checkout with form data
   ↓
2. Frontend receives request
   ↓
3. Frontend extracts form fields (email, address, credit card, etc.)
   ↓
4. Frontend validates payload using validator.PlaceOrderPayload.Validate()
   ↓
5. ❌ VALIDATION FAILS (credit card format invalid)
   ↓
6. Frontend returns HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
   ↓
7. CheckoutService is NEVER called!
```

### What Frontend DOES Call During Checkout

Before the validation failure, Frontend makes these calls:

```
Frontend → CartService (GetCart)           ✅ JWT sent
Frontend → ShippingService (GetQuote)      ✅ JWT sent  
Frontend → (validation fails)              ❌ Stops here
Frontend ✗ CheckoutService (never called)  ⏸️  Never reached
```

## 🐛 The Validation Issue

### Frontend Validator Code

```go
// src/frontend/validator/validator.go
type PlaceOrderPayload struct {
    Email         string `validate:"required,email"`
    StreetAddress string `validate:"required,max=512"`
    ZipCode       int64  `validate:"required"`
    City          string `validate:"required,max=128"`
    State         string `validate:"required,max=128"`
    Country       string `validate:"required,max=128"`
    CcNumber      string `validate:"required,credit_card"` // ← This fails!
    CcMonth       int64  `validate:"required,gte=1,lte=12"`
    CcYear        int64  `validate:"required"`
    CcCVV         int64  `validate:"required"`
}
```

### Test Script Data

```bash
CHECKOUT_DATA="credit_card_number=4432-8015-6152-0454"  # ← Has dashes!
```

The `credit_card` validator expects a format without dashes, or it fails validation.

## ✅ What We CAN Verify

### JWT Propagation That Works:

| Step | Frontend Call | JWT Sent? | Service Receives? | Evidence |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Homepage | CartService.GetCart | ✅ | ✅ | Logs show 879 bytes |
| Add Cart | CartService.AddItem | ✅ | ✅ | Logs show 879 bytes |
| View Cart | CartService.GetCart | ✅ | ✅ | Logs show 879 bytes |
| Checkout Quote | ShippingService.GetQuote | ✅ | ✅ | Logs show 879 bytes |
| **Checkout Order** | **CheckoutService.PlaceOrder** | **⏸️** | **⏸️** | **Never called (validation fails)** |

## 🔧 How to Fix and See Full JWT Flow

### Option 1: Fix Credit Card Format in Test

```bash
# Remove dashes from credit card number
CHECKOUT_DATA="${CHECKOUT_DATA}&credit_card_number=4432801561520454"
```

### Option 2: Use Valid Test Credit Card

```bash
# Use a known valid test card (Visa)
CHECKOUT_DATA="${CHECKOUT_DATA}&credit_card_number=4111111111111111"
```

### Option 3: Test CheckoutService Directly

```bash
# Call CheckoutService manually via gRPC to bypass frontend validation
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{
  "user_id": "test-user",
  "user_currency": "USD",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "credit_card": {"credit_card_number": "4111111111111111", ...},
  ...
}' localhost:5050 hipstershop.CheckoutService/PlaceOrder
```

## 📊 Expected Full JWT Flow (If Checkout Succeeds)

```
Browser
  ↓
Frontend (receives JWT from cookie)
  ↓
  ├→ CartService.GetCart          [JWT ✅]
  ├→ ShippingService.GetQuote      [JWT ✅]
  └→ CheckoutService.PlaceOrder    [JWT ✅] ← This is what we want to see!
      ↓
      CheckoutService (orchestrator)
        ↓
        ├→ ProductCatalogService   [JWT forwarded ✅]
        ├→ CartService             [JWT forwarded ✅]
        ├→ CurrencyService         [JWT forwarded ✅]
        ├→ ShippingService         [JWT forwarded ✅]
        ├→ PaymentService          [JWT forwarded ✅]
        └→ EmailService            [JWT forwarded ✅]
```

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Current Status:**
- ✅ JWT propagation works perfectly (Frontend → CartService, Frontend → ShippingService)
- ✅ JWT compression can be enabled
- ✅ Health check filtering works (clean logs)
- ⚠️ Full checkout flow blocked by form validation

**What's Working:**
- JWT generation in Frontend
- JWT forwarding via gRPC metadata
- JWT receiving in downstream services
- JWT compression/decompression (when enabled)

**What's NOT Working:**
- Checkout validation (credit card format)
- Full multi-hop JWT flow through CheckoutService

**To See Full Flow:**
Fix the credit card format in the test script, and you'll see:
```
[JWT-FLOW] Checkout Service ← Frontend: Received full JWT (879 bytes)
[JWT-FLOW] Checkout Service → PaymentService: Forwarding full JWT
[JWT-FLOW] Payment Service ← Checkout: Received full JWT (879 bytes)
[JWT-FLOW] Checkout Service → EmailService: Forwarding full JWT
[JWT-FLOW] Email Service ← Checkout: Received full JWT (879 bytes)
... etc
```

🚀 **JWT propagation is working - we just need valid checkout data to see the full flow!**

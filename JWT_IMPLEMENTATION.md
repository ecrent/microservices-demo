# JWT Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) propagation across the microservices-demo application. The JWT is issued by the frontend and forwarded through the service mesh.

## Architecture

### JWT Flow
```
Frontend (generates JWT)
   ↓ (gRPC metadata: authorization: Bearer <token>)
   ├→ Checkoutservice (receives & forwards JWT)
   │    ↓
   │    ├→ Cartservice (receives JWT) ✅ VERIFIED
   │    ├→ Shippingservice (receives JWT)
   │    ├→ Paymentservice (receives JWT)
   │    ├→ Emailservice (receives JWT)
   │    ├→ Currencyservice (receives JWT)
   │    └→ Productcatalogservice (receives JWT)
   │
   ├→ Cartservice (receives JWT directly from frontend)
   ├→ Recommendationservice (receives JWT)
   └→ Other services...
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend (Go) - JWT Issuance & Propagation
**Files Modified:**
- `/src/frontend/jwt.go` - JWT generation and validation
- `/src/frontend/grpc_interceptor.go` - Client interceptor to add JWT to outgoing gRPC calls
- `/src/frontend/main.go` - Load RSA keys and chain interceptors

**Key Features:**
- Generates JWT with RS256 (RSA asymmetric encryption)
- JWT payload includes: session_id, name ("Jane Doe"), market_id, currency, cart_id
- 5-minute expiration
- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookie (`shop_jwt`)
- JWT validated on incoming HTTP requests
- JWT forwarded to all backend gRPC services via metadata

### 2. Checkoutservice (Go) - JWT Forwarding
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/src/checkoutservice/jwt_forwarder.go` - Client interceptors for JWT forwarding
- `/src/checkoutservice/main.go` - Chain JWT forwarding interceptors

**Key Features:**
- Receives JWT from frontend via gRPC metadata
- Forwards JWT to downstream services:
  - Cartservice
  - Shippingservice
  - Paymentservice
  - Emailservice
  - Currencyservice
  - Productcatalogservice

### 3. Cartservice (C#) - JWT Logging (Verification)
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/src/cartservice/src/interceptors/JwtLoggingInterceptor.cs` - Server interceptor to log received JWTs
- `/src/cartservice/src/Startup.cs` - Register JWT logging interceptor

**Key Features:**
- Logs when JWT is received
- Demonstrates JWT propagation is working
- Shows JWT in authorization header format: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

## Verification

### JWT in Browser
✅ JWT visible in browser DevTools → Application → Cookies → `shop_jwt`

### JWT Propagation Logs
✅ Cartservice logs show JWT is being received:
```
[JWT] Received JWT in /hipstershop.CartService/GetCart: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZX...
[JWT] Received JWT in /hipstershop.CartService/AddItem: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZX...
```

## How It Works

### 1. JWT Generation (Frontend)
When a user visits the homepage:
1. Frontend checks for existing JWT cookie
2. If not present or invalid, generates new JWT
3. Signs with RSA private key
4. Sets `shop_jwt` HttpOnly cookie

### 2. JWT Propagation (gRPC Metadata)
When frontend calls backend services:
1. Unary/Stream client interceptor extracts JWT from HTTP context
2. Adds JWT to gRPC metadata: `authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. Backend service receives JWT in incoming metadata

### 3. JWT Forwarding (Backend Services)
When backend services call other services:
1. Unary/Stream client interceptor extracts JWT from incoming metadata
2. Forwards JWT to outgoing gRPC metadata
3. Next service receives JWT and repeats the process

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **RS256 Algorithm**: Asymmetric encryption allows services to verify JWT without sharing private key
2. **gRPC Metadata**: Standard way to pass headers in gRPC (similar to HTTP headers)
3. **Client Interceptors**: Automatically add JWT to all outgoing calls
4. **No Validation in Backend** (current): Services receive and forward JWT without validation
   - Future: Can add validation by distributing public key to all services

## Docker Images Built
- `frontend:jwt-with-propagation` - Frontend with JWT generation & propagation
- `checkoutservice:jwt-forwarding` - Checkoutservice with JWT forwarding
- `cartservice:jwt-logging` - Cartservice with JWT logging

## Next Steps (Future Enhancement)
If validation is needed in backend services:
1. Distribute `jwt_public_key.pem` to services
2. Add JWT validation logic (verify signature, check name == "Jane Doe", check expiration)
3. Return authentication errors for invalid JWTs
